# Module 7: Monitoring & Observability - Visibility into Your Cluster

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- âœ… Understand the importance of observability
- âœ… Set up Metrics Server for resource monitoring
- âœ… Master liveness and readiness probes
- âœ… Implement logging strategies
- âœ… Basic monitoring with Prometheus (intro)

## ðŸ“– Key Concepts

### The Three Pillars of Observability
1. **Metrics** - Numeric measurements over time
2. **Logs** - Detailed event records
3. **Traces** - Request flow through services

### Health Checks
```yaml
livenessProbe:   # Is the container alive?
readinessProbe:  # Is it ready to serve traffic?
startupProbe:    # For slow-starting containers
```

## ðŸš€ Coming Soon

This module is under development. Key topics will include:
- Installing and using Metrics Server
- Resource monitoring and limits
- Container health checks
- Centralized logging patterns
- Introduction to Prometheus and Grafana
