# Module 8: Troubleshooting Mastery - Debugging Like a Pro

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- âœ… Master systematic debugging approaches
- âœ… Understand common failure patterns
- âœ… Use advanced debugging tools
- âœ… Troubleshoot performance issues
- âœ… Practice with broken scenarios

## ðŸ“– Key Concepts

### Debugging Workflow
1. **Observe** - What are the symptoms?
2. **Hypothesize** - What could cause this?
3. **Test** - Verify your hypothesis
4. **Fix** - Apply the solution
5. **Verify** - Confirm it's resolved

### Essential Commands
```bash
kubectl describe pod <name>    # Detailed info
kubectl logs <pod> --previous  # Previous container logs
kubectl get events            # Cluster events
kubectl top nodes/pods        # Resource usage
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- sh  # Interactive debugging
```
